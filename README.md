Generate a very simple .epub from a single .txt.

There are a lot of these out there, but none did exactly what I need.  Once it's working, I'll upload it here (w/ instructions) in case anyone else has a similar niche need.

*NOTE:  On hold.  Decided to publish initial book using KDP Select, which supports formats other than ePub.  Exploring existing tools for other formats before investing in creating my own ePub generator.  Will return to this on a future book, or if I decide to publish initial book beyond just KDP Select.*
